This file is simply here to allow your browser's JavaScript console to access the petstore.js file.
<p>
We recommend you use <b>Google Chrome</b> for this assignment. Open the console by selecting View in the main menu, then Developer, then JavaScript Console.
</p><p>
If you are using <b>Safari</b>, you will need to enable the console by selecting Safari in the main menu, then Preferences, then Advanced, then checking "Show Develop menu in menu bar." Once you've done that, open it by selecting Develop in the main menu, then Show Error Console.
</p><p>
If you are using <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>, you can open the console by selecting Tools in the main menu, then Web Developer, then Web Console.
</p><p>
Once you've opened the console, type "<code>helloworld()</code>" in the console (without the quotes) to run the helloworld() function in petstore.js.
</p><p>
Your browser should print "hello world!" in the console. If so, you're ready to proceed!
